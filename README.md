Context-based Client and Server middleware libraries.

The libraries are meant to rely only on the standard `http` package functions and make heavy use of `context` (introduced in Go 1.7) for propagating state between handlers. The libraries come in two flavours:
 * server-side `Middleware` (`func (http.Handler) http.Handler)`) 
 * client-side `Tripperware` (`func (http.RoundTripper) http.RoundTripper`) 

These are meant as excellent companions for interceptors of [`github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware`](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware) making it easy to build combined gRPC/HTTP Golang servers.

For generic tripperware and middleware functions, see this package [documentation](DOC.md). For functionality wares, see
their relevant docs.

## Why?

Having a consistent set of inbound and outbound handlers make it easy to log, trace, auth and debug your handlers.
