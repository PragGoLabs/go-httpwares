`wares_tags` adds a Tag object to the context that can be used by other server middleware  to add context about a request.

Request Context Tags

Tags describe information about the request, and can be set and used by other middleware. Tags are used for logging
and tracing of requests.

If a user doesn't use the interceptors that initialize the `Tags` object, all operations following from an `Extract(ctx)`
will be no-ops. This is to ensure that code doesn't panic if the interceptors weren't used.

Tags fields are typed, and shallow and should follow the OpenTracing semantics convention:
https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/semantic_conventions.md
